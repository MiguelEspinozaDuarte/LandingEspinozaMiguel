        <p>Of my favorite artists and/or groups:</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Feid</h2>
                <p>Feid is one of my favorite artists, his music is very varied and I love it. His unique style and his ability to mix different genres in his songs make him stand out from the rest. He always surprises me with each new release and I'm excited to see what comes next.</p>

                <p>
                    Twenty One Pilots is one of my favorite bands, I love their very versatile style that combines elements of rock, hip-hop and electronica. Their lyrics are very deep and reflective, they talk about themes such as inner struggle, self-improvement and humanity. Their live energy is contagious, leaving me wanting to dance and sing along. Their music inspires me to be better and connects me with many emotions.

                <h2 class="subtitle">baseball</h2>
                <p>I like baseball for its strategy and tactical skill. The game requires a high level of concentration and precision, and each play is unique and exciting. Baseball is also a team sport, where collaboration and teamwork are critical to success.</p>

                <p>I like soccer because it is a team sport, where teamwork and collaboration are essential for success. The passion and feeling that this sport generates in the crowds is indescribable. It is a universal sport that unites people from different cultures and countries.</p>
